Traditional IT infrastructure typically involves in-house management of **physical servers**, **networking equipment, and storage solutions**. While this setup has worked for many years and continues to be effective for some companies, it comes with its **own set of challenges and limitations**.

The problems you can solve if you decide to build your software company on top of the cloud computing provider:

* Pay for the rent for the data center
* Pay for the power supply, cooling, maintenance
* Adding and replacing hardware takes time
* Scaling is limited
* Hire a 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
* How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire)
* Security team specialist
* Dealing with global distribution

There are different levels of IT solutions as a service, usually, the companies use a mix of those levels.
