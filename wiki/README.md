# AWS Cloud Fundamentals

### What is cloud computing?&#x20;



How does the traditional IT infrastructure (ON-PREMISE) scale?

Traditional IT infrastructure typically involves in-house management of **physical servers**, **networking equipment, and storage solutions**. While this setup has worked for many years and continues to be effective for some companies, it comes with its **own set of challenges and limitations**.

The problems you can solve if you decide to build your software company on top of the cloud computing provider:

* Pay for the rent for the data center
* Pay for the power supply, cooling, maintenance
* Adding and replacing hardware takes time
* Scaling is limited
* Hire a 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
* How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire)
* Security team specialist
* Dealing with global distribution

There are different levels of IT solutions as a service, usually, the companies use a mix of those levels.

### What does cloud computing provide as a service?&#x20;

* Cloud computing offers on-demand access to computing power, database storage, and various applications.
* It operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing you to pay only for the resources you actually use.
* Resources can be quickly scaled up or down to meet changing demands, providing flexibility and agility.
* Access is available over the internet from a variety of devices, making it highly accessible.
* Maintenance, security, and updates are generally managed by the service provider, reducing the burden on your in-house team.

### The five characteristics of cloud computing

1. On-Demand Self-Service: Users can allocate and manage resources themselves without needing to interact with a human service provider.
2. Broad Network Access: Cloud services are accessible over the internet from a variety of devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
3. Resource Pooling: Multiple users share a pool of computing resources, but these can be dynamically allocated and reassigned based on demand.
4. Rapid Elasticity: Resources can be quickly scaled up or down to accommodate varying workloads and demands.
5. Measured Service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resources, often using a metered, pay-as-you-go model.
