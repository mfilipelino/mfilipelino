# ðŸ’³ AWS Fundamentals

### Shared Responsibility Model

Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer.

IAM  - Identity and Access management&#x20;

* **Global** service
* **Root** accounts created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
* **Users** are people within your organization and can be grouped
* **Groups** only contain users, not other groups
* Users don't have to belong to a group and users can belong to multiple groups
* A user can belong to **multiple groups**



**IAM Permissions:** Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies, that allow them to have permission to use some actions in some specific resources

**The policies** define the permissions of the users

AWS explicitly applies the security principle: **Least privilege principle:** don't give more permissions than a user needs
