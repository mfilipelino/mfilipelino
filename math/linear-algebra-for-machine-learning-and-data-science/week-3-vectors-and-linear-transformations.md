# Week 3: Vectors and linear transformations

To assess your understanding of linear algebra concepts and determine if you can skip certain course materials, please answer the following questions:

1. **Vector Addition and Subtraction**: Given vectors (\vec{u} = (3, 6)) and (\vec{v} = (5, 2)), calculate (\vec{u} + \vec{v}) and (\vec{u} - \vec{v}). _Related Videos_: Vectors and their properties, Sum and difference of vectors.
2. **Distance Between Vectors**: What is the distance between vectors (\vec{u}) and (\vec{v})? _Related Video_: Distance between vectors.
3. **Scalar Multiplication**: Given (\vec{u} = (3, 5)), compute (6\vec{u}). _Related Video_: Multiplying a vector by a scalar.
4. **Dot Product**: For vectors (\vec{u} = (1, 2, 3)) and (\vec{v} = (0, 3, 5)), calculate the dot product (\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}).
5. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**: Given (\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \ 2 \ 5 \end{bmatrix}) and matrix (M = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 7 & 4 \ 5 & 1 & 2 \ 9 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}), find (M\vec{v}). _Related Video_: Multiplying a matrix by a vector.
6. **Linear Transformation Matrix**: If a linear transformation (T) is defined such that (T(0, 1) = (1, 2)) and (T(1, 0) = (4, 1)), determine the matrix representing this transformation. _Related Videos_: Matrices as linear transformations, Linear transformations as matrices.
7. **Matrix Operations**: With matrices (M = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \ 3 & 5 \end{bmatrix}) and (N = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}), compute (M \cdot N) and (N^{-1}). _Related Videos_: Matrix multiplication, The identity matrix, Matrix inverse, Which matrices have an inverse.

Answering these questions will help you gauge your understanding and guide you on which parts of the course you may need to focus on or can skip.
