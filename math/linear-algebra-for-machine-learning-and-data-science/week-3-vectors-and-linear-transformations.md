# Week 3: Vectors and linear transformations

### Assessment

We want your learning experience to be as efficient as possible. If you already know some linear algebra you might be able to skip some of the lectures in this course. Have a look at the questions below. If you already know how to answer them feel free to skip the videos listed in parentheses.

1\.  (Videos: [Vectors and their properties](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/lecture/5aEoU/vectors-and-their-properties), [Sum and difference of vectors](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/lecture/wAhh9/sum-and-difference-of-vectors))

2.(Video: [Distance between vectors](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/lecture/39OCb/distance-between-vectors))

3\. (Video: [Multiplying a vector by a scalar](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/lecture/3xHHt/multiplying-a-vector-by-a-scalar))

4\.&#x20;

5\. If �⃗=\[125]v=⎣⎢⎡​125​⎦⎥⎤​ and �=\[459710421]M=⎣⎢⎡​474​512​901​⎦⎥⎤​, compute ��⃗Mv. (Video: [Multiplying a matrix by a vector](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/lecture/a0YpR/multiplying-a-matrix-by-a-vector))

6\. If �T is a linear transformation defined as �(0,1)=(1,2)T(0,1)=(1,2) and �(1,0)=(4,1)T(1,0)=(4,1), find the matrix that represents this transformation. (Videos: [Matrices as linear transformations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/lecture/tvNBW/matrices-as-linear-transformations), [Linear transformations as matrices](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/lecture/kRqJQ/linear-transformations-as-matrices))

7\. If �=\[1235]M=\[13​25​] and �=\[4012]N=\[41​02​], compute �⋅�M⋅N and �−1N−1. (Videos: [Matrix multiplication](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/lecture/7yydj/matrix-multiplication), [The identity matrix](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/lecture/5tgI8/the-identity-matrix), [Matrix inverse](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/lecture/yQYqg/matrix-inverse), [Which matrices have an inverse](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/lecture/16RRm/which-matrices-have-an-inverse))
