# Problem-solving

Solving equations is all about finding unknown quantities.

#### Understand variables

Variables are placeholders for unknown quantities.

#### &#x20;Using variables

A variable is a letter or other symbol that is used in place of an unknown value.



#### Understanding Expressions

So far, weâ€™ve seen how variables represent unknown values. We can do a lot more with variables by using them to write expressions.

An **expression** connects numbers and variables with operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

\
An **equation** is a statement that two expressions have the same value

A **solution to an equation** is a value that, when used in place of a variable, makes the equation true.

Some equations are never true, some are always true, and some are only true for specific values of a variable.
