## Understanding Equations, Variables, and Expressions

### Equations

An equation is a mathematical statement asserting the equality of two expressions. It serves as a means to find unknown values.

#### Key Points

* **Definition**: An equation states that two expressions are equal in value.
* **Solution**: The solution to an equation is a specific value or set of values that, when substituted for the variable(s), makes the equation true.
* **Types of Equations**:
  * **Always True**: These equations hold for any value of the variable.
  * **Never True**: These are equations that are never valid, regardless of the variable's value.
  * **Conditionally True**: True only for specific values of the variable.

### Variables

Variables act as placeholders for unknown or variable quantities in mathematical expressions and equations.

#### Key Points

* **Definition**: A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) used to represent an unknown or arbitrary value.
* **Usage**: Variables allow for the generalization of mathematical concepts and operations.

### Expressions

Expressions are combinations of variables, numbers, and operations. They represent values but do not equate or compare like equations.

#### Key Points

* **Definition**: An expression is a mathematical phrase combining numbers, variables, and operational symbols.
* **Components**:
  * **Numbers**: Known constants or coefficients.
  * **Variables**: Symbols representing unknown values.
  * **Operations**: Mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Purpose**: Expressions are used to denote values and are fundamental in forming equations and solving mathematical problems.
