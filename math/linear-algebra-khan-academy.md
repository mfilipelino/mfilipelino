# Linear algebra - Khan academy

## Vectors

Vectors are used to represent many things around us: from forces like gravity, acceleration, friction, stress and strain on structures, to computer graphics used in almost all modern-day movies and video games. Vectors are an important concept, not just in math, but in physics, engineering, and computer graphics, so you're likely to see them again in other subjects.

**Vectors** have magnitude and direction

**Scalar** has only a magnitude



## Linear combinations and spans



## Linear dependence and independence



## Subspaces and the basis for a subspace



## Vector dot and cross-products



## Matrices for solving systems by elimination

## Null space and column space
