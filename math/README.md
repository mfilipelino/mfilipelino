# Vectors

### Meet vectors



A **vector** is a shift in space. We can represent it with an arrow.

A vector has a horizontal part and a vertical part, called **components**.

Vectors that have the same components are the **same vector**



### Vectors and points

The way we write the vector ⟨3,4⟩ and the point (3,4) look really similar.

Are the vector and point really the same thing?&#x20;

No. One is a **move**, while the other is a **location**

When a vector \<a,b> shifts an object starting from the origin, the object end up at the point (a,b)



_**We can think of a vector as a shift in space.**_
