# Vectors

## Meet vectors



A **vector** is a shift in space. We can represent it with an arrow.

A vector has a horizontal part and a vertical part, called **components**. The components of a vector are the horizontal and vertical distances that it travels. In $$\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}$$ a nd b are the components

How do we get to the point in the exact middle?

Vectors that have the same components are the **same vector**



### Vectors and points

The way we write the vector ⟨3,4⟩ and the point (3,4) look really similar.

Are the vector and point really the same thing?&#x20;

No. One is a **move**, while the other is a **location**

When a vector \<a,b> shifts an object starting from the origin, the object ends up at the point (a,b)



_**We can think of a vector as a shift in space.**_



## Adding vectors

Let's see how to express a sequence of moves, and then how to reverse a move



A sequence of shifts is equivalent to a shift by **one** vector.

That vector goes from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector.



A **component** is a part of a vector. The components tell how much a shift the vector produces in the horizontal and vertical directions.

For example, the vector ⟨3,4⟩ has a horizontal component of 3, and a vertical component of 4.



To find the effect of shifting by multiple vectors in order, we can **add the vectors.**

That means adding up the vectors' components

\<a,b> + \<c,d> = \<a + c, b + d>

* By adding vectors, we can find one vector that's equivalent to a sequence of shifts.
* By changing the sign of a vector's components, we can reverse the vector's direction.

## From One to Another



## Length of a vector

To know how far something moves, or the distance between two things, we can use the length of a vector.

We can use geometry to calculate vector lengths.

By treating a vector and its components as a right triangle, we can apply the **Pythagorean theorem** to find the vector's length.

$$\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2}$$)

That lets us find the distance between a pair of objects.



## Scaling vectors

Sometimes we need to change a vector's length while maintaining its direction.

k > 0: Scaling a vector maintains its direction while changing its length.

## Between two Vectors

Between the heads of two vectors, there are infinitely many points.

How do we get to the point in the exact middle?
